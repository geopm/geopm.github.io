<p class="man-name">
  <code>geopm</code> - <span class="man-whatis">global extensible open power manager</span>
</p>

<h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM) is an extensible
power management framework targeting high performance computing.  The
library can be extended to support new control algorithms and new
hardware power management features.  The GEOPM package provides built
in features ranging from static management of power policy for each
individual compute node, to dynamic coordination of power policy and
performance across all of the compute nodes hosting one MPI job on a
portion of a distributed computing system.  The dynamic coordination
is implemented as a hierarchical control system for scalable
communication and decentralized control.  The hierarchical control
system can optimize for various objective functions including
maximizing global application performance within a power bound.  The
root of the control hierarchy tree can communicate through shared
memory with the system resource management daemon to extend the
hierarchy above the individual MPI job level and enable management of
system power resources for multiple MPI jobs and multiple users by the
system resource manager.  The GEOPM package provides the libgeopm
library, the libgeopmpolicy library, the geopmctl application and the
geopmpolicy application.  The libgeopm library can be called within
MPI applications to enable application feedback for informing the
control decisions.  If modification of the target application is not
desired then the geopmctl application can be run concurrently with the
target application.  In this case, target application feedback is
inferred by querying the hardware through Model Specific Registers
(MSRs).  With either method (libgeopm or geopmctl), the control
hierarchy tree writes processor power policy through MSRs to enact
policy decisions.  The libgeopmpolicy library is used by a resource
manager to set energy policy control parameters for MPI jobs.  Some
features of libgeopmpolicy are available through the geopmpolicy
application including support for static control.</p>

<h2 id="INTEGRATION-WITH-PMPI">INTEGRATION WITH PMPI</h2>

<p>Linking to libgeopm will define symbols that intercept the MPI
interface through PMPI.  This can be disabled with the configure time
option <code>--disable-pmpi</code>, but is enabled by default.  See
<code>LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK</code> environment variable description below for the
runtime requirements of the PMPI design.  When using the GEOPM PMPI
interposition other profilers which use the same method will be in
conflict.  The GEOPM runtime can create a application performance
profile report and a trace of the application runtime.  As such, GEOPM
serves the role of an application profiler in addition to management
of power resources.  The report and trace generation are controlled by
the environment variables <code>GEOPM_REPORT</code> and <code>GEOPM_TRACE</code>; see
description below.</p>

<h2 id="INTEGRATION-WITH-OMPT">INTEGRATION WITH OMPT</h2>

<p>When the OpenMP runtime compiled with GEOPM supports the OMPT
interface, GEOPM will use the OMPT callbacks wrap OpenMP parallel
regions with calls to <code>geopm_prof_enter()</code> and <code>geopm_prof_exit()</code>.
In this way any OpenMP parallel region not within another application
defined region will be reported to the GEOPM runtime.  This will
appear in the report as a region name beginning with "[OMPT]" and
referencing the object file and function name containing the OpenMP
parallel region e.g.</p>

<p><code>[OMPT]tutorial_6:geopm::StreamModelRegion::run()</code></p>

<p>To expressly enable this feature pass the <code>--enable-ompt</code> configure
flag at GEOPM build time.  This will build and install the LLVM OpenMP
runtime configured to support OMPT if the default OpenMP runtime does
not support the OMPT callbacks.  Note that your compiler must be
compatible with the LLVM OpenMP ABI for extending it in this way.</p>

<h2 id="LAUNCHING-THE-RUNTIME">LAUNCHING THE RUNTIME</h2>

<p>The recommended methods for launching the GEOPM runtime are the job
launch wrapper scripts <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmsrun.1.html">geopmsrun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> and <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmaprun.1.html">geopmaprun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong>.  See
these man pages for details about the command line interface.  If your
system does not support <code>aprun</code> or <code>srun</code> for job launch, please make
a change request for support of the job launch method used on your
system at the github issues page:</p>

<p>https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues</p>

<p>Also, consider porting your job launch command into the
geopmpy.launcher module and submitting a change request as described
in CONTRIBUTING.md.</p>

<p>If the job launch application is not supported by the geopmpy.launcher
the recommended method is to use the environment variables described
in this man page including the <code>GEOPM_PMPI_CTL</code> environment variable.
If using the "application" launch method then the <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmctl.1.html">geopmctl<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong>
application should be launched in parallel.</p>

<p>There are legacy methods for launching the runtime programmatically.
These are documented in <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_ctl_c.3.html">geopm_ctl_c<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong>, but are deprecated as an
application facing interface because their use within an application
is incompatible with the GEOPM launcher script.</p>

<h2 id="PLOTTING-REPORT-AND-TRACE-DATA">PLOTTING REPORT AND TRACE DATA</h2>

<p>Please see the <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmplotter.1.html">geopmplotter<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> and <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmanalysis.1.html">geopmanalysis<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong>
man pages for information about the
data analysis tools available for visualizing the data contained in
the GEOPM report and trace files.  The report file is intended to be
human readable, and the trace file format can be easily parsed by a
wide variety of analysis applications.</p>

<h2 id="INTERPRETING-THE-REPORT">INTERPRETING THE REPORT</h2>

<p>If the <code>GEOPM_REPORT</code> environment variable is set then a report will
be generated.  There is one report file generated for each run.  This
file has a header that describes the GEOPM version and the policies
that were used during the run.  This is followed by a breakdown first
by compute node host name and then by each compute region.  The report
file gives information about runtime and energy use for each
identified code region. Additionally, time spent in calls to MPI is
reported.  In the future the report may contain more data describing
the application.</p>

<p>It is important to note that per-region accounting in the report
includes only time spent in the region by all MPI ranks concurrently
on each compute node.  During the time when two ranks on a compute
node are not in the same marked region, the data collected is
attributed to the "unmarked" code region.  See the
<code>GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER</code> environment variable for more information about
debugging issues related region synchronicity.  In the future the
scope of this requirement may change from all ranks on a node to all
ranks running within the same domain of control.</p>

<h2 id="INTERPRETING-THE-TRACE">INTERPRETING THE TRACE</h2>

<p>If the <code>GEOPM_TRACE</code> environment variable is set (see below) then a
trace file with time ordered information about the application runtime
is generated.  A separate trace file is generated for each compute
node and each file is a pipe (the <code>|</code> character) delimited ASCII
table. The file begins with a header that is marked by lines that
start with the <code>#</code> character.  The header contains information about
the GEOPM version and the policy that was used during the run.</p>

<p>The first row following the header gives a description of each field.
A simple method for selecting fields from the trace file is with the
<code>awk</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -v '^#' geopm.trace-host0 | awk -F\| '{print $1, $2, $11}'
</code></pre>

<p>will print a subset of the fields in the trace file called
"geopm.trace-host0".</p>

<h2 id="ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</h2>

<p>When using the launcher wrapper scripts <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmsrun.1.html">geopmsrun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> or
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmaprun.1.html">geopmaprun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong>, the interface to the GEOPM runtime is controlled
exclusively by the launcher command line options.  The launcher script
sets the environment variables described in this section according to
the options specified on the command line.  Direct use of these
environment variables is only recommended when launching the GEOPM
runtime without <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmsrun.1.html">geopmsrun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> or <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmaprun.1.html">geopmaprun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong>.  The one
exception is <code>GEOPM_RM</code> which can be used to control the resource
manager selected by the wrapper script.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK</code></dt><dd><p>When dynamically linking an application to libgeopm for any
features supported by the PMPI profiling of the MPI runtime it may
be required that the LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK environment variable be set
at runtime as is documented in the <strong><a class="man-ref" href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/ld.so">ld.so<span class="s">(8)</span></a></strong> man page.  When
dynamically linking an application, if care is taken to link the
libgeopm library before linking the library providing the weak MPI
symbols, e.g. "-lgeopm -lmpi", linking order precedence will
enforce the required override of the MPI interface symbols and the
LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK environment variable is not required at runtime.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_REPORT</code></dt><dd><p>If set then a report will be generated by the controller when it
is destroyed.  The value of the variable determines the name of
file generated.  The report contains a summary of performance and
power aggregated over the program execution time and split out by
host compute node and each code region.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_TRACE</code></dt><dd><p>Enables GEOPM tracing capability.  Setting this variable enables
the creation of a trace output file. The value of the variable is
used as the base of the output trace file path.  One trace file is
generated per compute node.  The file names of each trace are
constructed by appending the node's hostname to base name given by
the environment variable (separated by a '-').</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_SHMKEY</code></dt><dd><p>Override the default shared memory key base.  The shared memory
key base prefixes all shared memory keys used by GEOPM to
communicate between the compute application and the GEOPM runtime.
The default key base is '/geopm-shm', this can be overridden by
the environment variable.  The base key is extended for each
shared memory region used by the runtime.  These keys should be
cleaned up by the exception handler in case of an error or OS
signal other than SIGKILL.  If the application is killed with
SIGKILL or the keys are left behind for any other reason, a simple
command to clean up after an aborted job is:</p>

<p><code>$ test -n "$GEOPM_SHMKEY" &amp;&amp; rm -f /dev/shm${GEOPM_SHMKEY}* || rm -f /dev/shm/geopm-shm*</code></p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_POLICY</code></dt><dd><p>Defines the default policy. The value is either a shared memory
key or JSON file path.  This environment variable must be set when
launching the GEOPM controller through the PMPI interface (see
GEOPM_PMPI_CTL environment variable below).  A shared memory key
must begin with the '/' character and have no other occurrence of
the '/' character.  All other values are assumed to refer to a
JSON file path.  When using a shared memory policy the resource
manager creates the shared memory region and dynamically controls
the global policy by modifying the region at runtime.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_PMPI_CTL</code></dt><dd><p>When set to 'process' or 'pthread' this environment variable
enables the launch of the GEOPM controller through the PMPI
wrappers: in particular the wrappers for MPI_Init() or
MPI_Init_thread().  In the case of specifying 'process' the
controller will run as separate processes on a split off
communicator comprised of the lowest rank on each node.
Additionally through interception with the PMPI wrappers, the
application MPI_COMM_WORLD appears to have one fewer rank per node
than was allocated to the job.  In the case of specifying
'pthread' the lowest rank on each node will launch a pthread
running the controller.  The pthread launch mechanism requires an
MPI runtime that can support MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE.  Support for
this feature may require the LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK variable as
documented above.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_PROFILE</code></dt><dd><p>If set, will override the profile name to the value specified.
The default profile name is the name of the compute application
executable.  The profile name is printed in the report and trace
and can be used to index the report and trace data during
post-processing.  When launching the GEOPM runtime with the geopmctl
application, this variable must be set in the environment for
the compute application and the geopmctl application.  The value
of the variable must be the same in both contexts.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_PROFILE_TIMEOUT</code></dt><dd><p>If set, will enable changing of the GEOPM profiler timeout.  The
value is in seconds and represents the amount of time any application
rank will wait for the controller before continuing execution. The
default timeout is 30 seconds.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_PLUGIN_PATH</code></dt><dd><p>The search path for GEOPM plugins. It is a colon-separated list
of directories used by GEOPM to search for shared objects which
contain GEOPM plugins.  A zero-length directory name indicates the
current working directory.  A zero-length directory is inferred by
a leading or trailing colon or two adjacent colons.  The default
search location is always searched and is determined at library
configuration time and by way of the 'pkglib' variable (typically
/usr/lib64/geopm/).</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_DEBUG_ATTACH</code></dt><dd><p>Enables a serial debugger such as gdb to attach to a job when the
GEOPM PMPI wrappers are enabled.  If set to a numerical value the
associated rank will be trapped in MPI_Init() until a debugger is
attached and the local variable "cont" is set to a non-zero value.
If set, but not to a numerical value then all ranks are trapped.
The runtime will print a message explaining the hostname and
process ID that the debugger should attach to.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER</code></dt><dd><p>Enables a node local MPI_Barrier() at time of calling
<code>geopm_region_enter</code>() or <code>geopm_region_exit</code>() for all
application ranks that share a node.  Since the GEOPM controller
only considers a region to be entered when all ranks on a node
have entered the region, enabling this feature forces control
throughout all of the time every rank spends in a region.  This
feature is primarily used for debugging purposes.  WARNING: If all
regions marked in the application are not entered synchronously by
all ranks on a node then enabling this feature will cause a
deadlock and the application will hang.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_ERROR_AFFINITY_IGNORE</code></dt><dd><p>If set, errors of the type GEOPM_ERROR_AFFINITY are ignored by
GEOPM.  This is useful for testing on systems where CPU affinity
requirements cannot be met (e.g. Mac OS X). See <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_error.3.html">geopm_error<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong>
for more information on this error condition.  Note that this is
only useful for testing some parts of the GEOPM runtime.  The full
GEOPM runtime will not function at all in a multi-node setting
with this environment variable set.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_RM</code></dt><dd><p>Used by job launch wrapper (geopmsrun or geopmaprun) to override
the resource manager to use for job launch.  This environment
variable serves the same purpose as the <code>--geopm-rm</code> command line
option.  The valid values for the variable or command line option
are detailed in the <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmsrun.1.html">geopmsrun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> or <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmaprun.1.html">geopmaprun<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> man
pages.  Note that the command line option overrides what is set in
the environment.  If not set the script will attempt to determine
the resource manager based on the executable name, your PATH and
hostname.  This variable is also used by the integration tests.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_COMM</code></dt><dd><p>Used to select the plugin description string for communication.
The communication plugin is not currently used, but in the future
the the comm plugin will be used for all communication between
Controllers running on different nodes.  The only installed
communication plugin uses MPI and the description string is "MPIComm".
The user may wish to implement other communication mechanisms, please
refer to the GEOPM Plugin Developer's Guide for detailed information.</p></dd>
<dt><code>GEOPM_DISABLE_HYPERTHREADS</code></dt><dd><p>Used by job launch wrapper (geopmsrun or geopmaprun) to disable
the usage of hyperthreads for pinning purposes.  The default behavior
is to use hyperthreads for pinning.  This environment variable serves
the same purpose as the <code>--geopm-disable-hyperthreads</code> command line
option.  If the environment variable is set and/or the command line
option is specified then hyperthreads will be disabled.</p></dd>
